# Computer Vision Portfolio
Some of my projects on computer vision.

All these are non-guided projects.

* **Image classification project with TensorFlow 2 and Keras** (image_clsf_neural_network.ipynb): project where I explore ways to maximize the accuracy score with hyperparameter tuning, regularization and optimization.
